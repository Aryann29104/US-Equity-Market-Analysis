## 📊 US Equity Market Analysis Dashboard (2016–2017)

This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** analyzing the **US equity market during 2016–2017**. The goal of this analysis is to understand market structure, sector-wise dominance, valuation patterns, dividend performance, and stock volatility using key financial metrics.

## Dataset Scope & Representation

This project uses a dataset containing **505 publicly listed companies**, which represents a **curated subset of the broader US equity market**.

In reality, the US stock market consists of **4,000+ listed companies** across major exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ. However, for analytical clarity and performance optimization, this dataset focuses on a **representative sample**, primarily covering well established and actively traded companies.

### Why this approach is valid:

* Many financial datasets intentionally limit scope to improve **data quality and interpretability**
* A focused subset allows for **clear sectoral, valuation, and performance comparisons**
* Common market benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500) also rely on **limited company samples**
* The insights derived remain **directionally accurate and analytically meaningful**

This makes the dataset well-suited for **market structure analysis, valuation comparison, and financial storytelling**, while keeping the dashboard concise and insightful.

### 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze overall **market capitalization** and its distribution across sectors
* Compare company valuations using **P/E Ratio and Price-to-Book Ratio**
* Identify **top companies by market capitalization**
* Highlight **high dividend yield stocks**
* Assess stock **volatility using 52-week price range**

### 📈 Key Dashboard Features

* Market Overview with KPI cards (Total Market Cap, Avg P/E, Avg Dividend Yield, Number of Companies)
* Sector-wise Market Cap Treemap
* Valuation Scatter Plot (P/E vs Price/Book with Market Cap as bubble size)
* Top 10 Companies by Market Capitalization
* Dividend Yield & Volatility analysis with interactive filters

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI**
* **DAX** for calculated measures
* **Data Modeling & Cleaning**
* **Interactive Data Visualization**

### 🧠 Key Learnings

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **financial data analysis**, **dashboard design principles**, and **data storytelling**, while translating complex market data into clear and actionable insights.
